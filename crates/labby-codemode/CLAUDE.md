# labby-codemode — Host-Neutral Code Mode Runner

This crate owns the host-neutral JavaScript execution sandbox. Gateway-specific
catalog/search wiring lives in `labby-gateway`; this crate should stay focused
on runner execution, protocol, snippet/artifact handling, normalization, and
shared Code Mode data types.

Exception: this crate also owns Labby's runner-reserved local Code Mode
providers (`state` and `git`). They are not host upstream tools. They may be
injected and dispatched only for unscoped admin/trusted-local callers; any
route-scoped or tool-scoped run must not see or call them. If Code Mode later
gains tenant/workspace identity beyond the current local workspace model, move
the local-provider policy behind a typed host-supplied context rather than
letting these namespaces become general host tools.

`codemode.search`/`codemode.describe` intentionally do **not** use this
admin-only gate. They stay pure in-sandbox JS closures over a catalog that is
already scope-filtered per-entry via `scope.allows()` before the discovery/proxy
JS is generated (`execute.rs`'s `build_code_mode_proxy`), and remain available to
any `can_execute()` caller, including route-scoped and tool-scoped ones. A prior
investigation (bead `lab-5cgrz`) evaluated converting them to host-intercepted
RPC pseudo-tools reusing the `local_provider.rs` pattern and rejected it: the
claimed injection cost is negligible at current scale, the RPC path would likely
be *slower* for repeated search/describe calls (it would serialize behind the
global local-provider lock), and reusing `local_providers_allowed()` verbatim
would wrongly restrict search/describe to admin-only. If this is ever revisited,
re-derive the cost data first and solve, at minimum: the caller-gating mismatch
above, the risk of double-fetching `CodeModeHost::list_tools()` per RPC call
instead of once per execution, and the fact that `CatalogRenderCache`
(`labby-gateway`) is a single-slot cache with no scope component in its
fingerprint — safe today only because it is reached exclusively through the
unscoped CLI path.

## Runtime — Javy/QuickJS via subprocess stdio (NOT Wasmtime)

The live Code Mode runner is a **Javy/QuickJS subprocess** communicated with
over a framed stdio line protocol. There is NO Wasmtime/fuel path on any live
code path; the old Wasmtime runner reference file was deleted during extraction.

Execution limits (QuickJS side):
- **30-second wall-clock timeout** — enforced by `runner_drive.rs` via `tokio::time::timeout`.
- **64 MiB memory limit** — enforced by the Javy runtime at start-up.
- **Stack depth limit** — enforced by QuickJS natively.

The emitted `ToolError` kind when the wall-clock timer fires is `"timeout"`.
`code_mode_fuel_exhausted` is NOT emitted by this runner; see `docs/dev/ERRORS.md`.

## Warm-runner pool (Perf H1)

The runner **process** is pooled and long-lived; the **JS runtime is rebuilt
per execution**. This amortizes the dominant fixed cost (fork + process startup)
while guaranteeing JS-state isolation by construction.

- **Runner loop.** `runner.rs` reads a `Start` → builds a FRESH `javy::Runtime`
  + context → installs the bridge globals → runs to settle → emits `Done`/`Error`
  → resets per-execution state and **loops back to read the next `Start`**. The
  process never exits except on stdin EOF (parent dropped the runner).
- **Fresh runtime per `Start` is the contract.** Never reuse a `javy::Runtime`
  across executions — a brand-new runtime has no globals, no
  `__labPendingToolCalls`, and no captured data from a prior caller. This is
  where cross-caller leakage would live.
- **Per-execution resets** (`runner.rs`): the `next_seq` counter resets to 0, and
  a fresh per-execution cwd jail subdir is created (the previous one removed) so a
  pooled process never accumulates working-directory state across runs.
- **Parent pool** (`pool.rs`, `pool/runner_handle.rs`, `pool/config.rs`): a
  bounded set of long-lived runner handles, one execution per runner at a time
  (`size` runners ⇒ `size` concurrent executions). Slot ownership uses an explicit
  free-list so concurrent checkouts never collide.
- **Disposition.** `drive_runner` classifies each run: clean `Done` or a
  per-execution `Error` → the runner is parked and **released** back to the pool
  (it stayed alive with a fresh runtime); a crash (EOF/exit), timeout, or protocol
  fault → the runner is **evicted** (killed) and the slot respawns next checkout.
- **Recycle-after-K.** A pooled runner is killed+respawned after `recycle_after`
  executions (default 100) as cheap insurance against native-side fragmentation.
- **Backpressure.** When all pooled slots are busy, a checkout spawns a bounded
  ephemeral (overflow) runner (`max_overflow` cap) — never unbounded growth, never
  an indefinite queue. Overflow is logged at `action = "pool.overflow"`.
- **Config + kill switch** (env, read at manager construction):
  - `LAB_CODE_MODE_POOL_SIZE` — pooled runners (default 2, clamped to 16).
    **`0` disables pooling** → the drive layer falls back to spawn-per-execution
    (byte-identical to the pre-pool path).
  - `LAB_CODE_MODE_POOL_RECYCLE_AFTER` — executions before recycle (default 100).
  - `LAB_CODE_MODE_POOL_MAX_OVERFLOW` — max simultaneous ephemeral runners
    (default 8).
- **Security invariants persist for the pooled process** because they are set
  once at spawn: `env_clear()`, `process_group(0)`/Job Object, `kill_on_drop`,
  `prctl(PR_SET_DUMPABLE, 0)`. The 64 MiB heap / 30 s wall-clock / stack limits are
  enforced PER EXECUTION (heap+stack by the fresh runtime; wall-clock by the parent
  `drive_runner` deadline, which kills+evicts on expiry rather than reusing a
  runtime interrupted mid-execution).

When the broker has no `GatewayManager` (some tests / standalone paths) there is
no pool; it spawns a one-shot runner directly (the handle's `Drop` kills it).

## Parent ↔ Runner stdio Protocol

Messages are newline-delimited JSON sent over the child's stdin/stdout. A single
runner process serves **multiple** `Start`→`Done`/`Error` cycles over its
lifetime (warm pool); it parks on the next `Start` read after each and exits only
on stdin EOF.

Messages are tagged by a `"type"` field (serde `tag = "type"`, snake_case), NOT
a `"kind"` field. `protocol.rs` is the source of truth; the shapes below mirror
`CodeModeRunnerInput` / `CodeModeRunnerOutput`.

**Parent → runner (`CodeModeRunnerInput`):**

```jsonc
// Start an execution (the runtime is rebuilt fresh per Start)
{ "type": "start", "code": "<js source>", "proxy": "<generated codemode proxy js>" }

// Reply to a tool_call broker request
{ "type": "tool_result", "seq": <u64>, "result": <json> }

// Reply to a snippet_resolve request with resolved snippet source
{ "type": "snippet_resolved", "seq": <u64>, "code": "<js>", "input": <json> }

// Reply to a tool_call/snippet_resolve with a structured error
{ "type": "tool_error", "seq": <u64>, "kind": "<error kind>", "message": "<string>" }
```

**Runner → parent (`CodeModeRunnerOutput`):**

```jsonc
// Runner wants to call an upstream tool
{ "type": "tool_call", "seq": <u64>, "id": "<upstream::name>", "params": <json> }

// Runner wants to write an artifact
{ "type": "artifact_write", "seq": <u64>, "path": "<rel path>", "content": "<string>", "content_type": "<media type>" }

// Runner wants to resolve a snippet by name
{ "type": "snippet_resolve", "seq": <u64>, "name": "<snippet>", "input": <json> }

// Execution completed
{ "type": "done", "result": { "state": "json"|"undefined", "value": <json> }, "logs": ["..."] }

// Execution error (JS exception or internal runner error)
{ "type": "error", "kind": "<error kind>", "message": "<string>" }
```

The runner parks for the next `start` after each `done`/`error` and exits only on
stdin EOF (no explicit `shutdown`/`ready` messages on the wire). Do not add fields
to the wire protocol without updating both sides and `protocol.rs`.

## Sandbox Containment Invariants

The following invariants govern runner subprocess security. All rows below are
**implemented** on the live code path — there are no remaining "(planned)"
items.

| Invariant | Current state |
|-----------|--------------|
| No ambient network APIs | Enforced by QuickJS — no `fetch`, no `XMLHttpRequest`, no Node builtins |
| No dynamic import of host modules | Enforced by QuickJS module resolver |
| Process-group guard | Runner spawned with `process_group(0)` (Unix) / Job Object (Windows); `kill_on_drop(true)`; `killpg` reaches grandchildren |
| Env isolation | **Implemented.** Runner spawned with `env_clear()` (`pool/runner_handle.rs`, in `PooledRunner::spawn`) — the child inherits NO labby env at all (not even an allowlist), so `LAB_*` secrets and every other ambient var are excluded. |
| `PR_SET_DUMPABLE` | **Implemented.** `runner.rs:22` calls `prctl(PR_SET_DUMPABLE, 0)` as the runner's first act on Linux, blocking `/proc/<pid>/environ` readback. Failure is non-fatal and warns via stderr (drained into the parent's response logs). |
| Per-run cwd isolation | Each runner has a long-lived spawn `TempDir`; the runner creates a FRESH per-execution jail subdir under it on every `Start` and removes the previous one (`runner.rs::reset_execution_jail`), so a pooled process never accumulates cwd state across runs. The `TempDir` is removed when the runner handle drops. |
| Artifact path containment | Enforced: `artifacts.rs` rejects any traversal/absolute component up front (`reject_path_traversal`), normalizes `\`→`/`, joins lexically under the per-run jail root, then walks the destination's ancestors with `symlink_metadata` (`reject_existing_symlink_ancestors`) to reject any existing symlink in the path. (Lexical + lstat-walk containment — it deliberately does **not** call `std::fs::canonicalize`.) |
| Artifact size cap | Enforced: 8 MiB default (`LAB_CODE_MODE_ARTIFACT_MAX_MIB`) |
| Tool call budget | Not enforced. Code Mode is bounded by wall-clock timeout, sandbox memory/stack, output/log/artifact caps, and host-side tool policy. |

**Writing tests that assert on env isolation:** `env_clear()` has landed, so a
test asserting the runner child has a minimal/empty environment reflects real
behavior and need NOT be `#[ignore]` when it can inspect the child hermetically
(e.g. via the runner's own reporting). Do not re-introduce an `#[ignore]` "until
env_clear lands" comment — that state is in the past.

## File Responsibilities

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `runner.rs` | Runner subprocess entry point: the warm-pool loop (read `Start` → fresh runtime → run → `Done`/`Error` → reset + park), per-execution seq + cwd-jail reset, `PR_SET_DUMPABLE`. |
| `runner_drive.rs` | Parent-side driver: acquires a runner (pool lease or standalone), drives the protocol loop, classifies the outcome (`Completed`/`ExecutionError`/`RunnerUnhealthy`), wall-clock timeout, and finalizes the lease (release vs evict). |
| `pool.rs` | `RunnerPool` + `RunnerLease`: bounded warm pool, free-list slot ownership, recycle-after-K, bounded ephemeral overflow, kill switch. |
| `pool/runner_handle.rs` | `PooledRunner`: one long-lived runner process + its stdin/lines/stderr-drain, process-group/Job-Object guard, spawn (`env_clear`, `process_group`, `kill_on_drop`). |
| `pool/config.rs` | `PoolConfig`: env-driven pool size / recycle / overflow knobs and the kill switch. |
| `runner_io.rs` | Framed stdio line protocol with the child process. |
| `execute.rs` | `execute()` entry point: build context, inject preamble, call driver, return result. Also owns mcp-ui widget capture: `extract_ui_link` records an upstream result's `_meta.ui` (last-wins, into the per-run `CodeModeBroker::ui_capture` sink) before the envelope is unwrapped, and `apply_ui_opt_in` surfaces it on the final response while preserving `{ __ui: <result> }` unwrapping compatibility. |
| `host.rs` | Host trait and adapters that let gateway or tests provide tool/snippet/artifact behavior without coupling this crate back to gateway. |
| `broker.rs` | Broker implementation for tool calls, snippet resolution, artifact writes, and per-run UI capture. |
| `preamble.rs` | Injects the `callTool` bridge stub and catalog proxy into the JS environment. |
| `protocol.rs` | Wire types for all parent↔runner messages (serialization-stable). |
| `schema.rs` | JSON Schema helpers for tool description injection. |
| `normalize.rs` | Result normalization after runner returns. |
| `shape.rs` | Result shape metadata helpers. |
| `truncate.rs` | Output size limiting before returning to caller. |
| `trace.rs` | Execution span helpers (`tracing`). |
| `types.rs` | Shared Code Mode types: tool descriptors, callers, scopes, execution responses, traces, and UI links. |
| `ts_signatures.rs` | **Live** TypeScript signature / `.d.ts` generator called by `types.rs::CodeModeCatalogEntry::upstream_tool`. NOT legacy shims. |
| `util.rs` | Small utilities: JS source wrapping, ID generation. |
| `artifacts.rs` | Artifact write handler: path containment check, size cap, atomic write. |
| `snippet.rs`, `snippet/store.rs` | Snippet resolution types and filesystem-backed snippet store. |
| `wrapper.rs` | Wraps caller snippets in the async IIFE harness expected by the runner. |

## Rules

- Do not reintroduce Wasmtime/fuel execution paths; the live kind is `"timeout"`.
- Do not add `code_mode_fuel_exhausted` to new match arms; the live kind is `"timeout"`.
- Do not expose host network APIs to the runner child.
- Keep `protocol.rs` as the single serialization-stable wire contract. The
  mcp-ui `{ __ui: <result> }` wrapper is a **host-side return convention**
  detected on the runner's returned `result` — it adds **no** new parent↔runner
  wire fields.
- Keep each file under 500 LOC; split following the existing pattern if a file grows.
