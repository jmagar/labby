# agent-os (Windows sandbox VM)

Drive Claude's dedicated sandboxed Windows 11 VM, the **`agent-os`** VM (container name `agent-os-win11`, image `dockur/windows`) on host `tootie`, historically nicknamed "winbox", through the **Windows-MCP** server installed inside it. The skill name is now `agent-os`; both `agent-os` and legacy `winbox` work as trigger phrases.

## What changed

This skill used to drive the VM over noVNC at `http://tootie:8006` via `agent-browser`, dispatching `MouseEvent`s on the canvas and typing one keystroke at a time. That path worked but was slow and had a known `Shift+<digit>` bug.

Windows-MCP ([CursorTouch/Windows-MCP](https://github.com/CursorTouch/Windows-MCP)) replaces it. The MCP server runs inside the agent-os VM and exposes native Windows automation as `mcp__windows-mcp__*` tools. You get a real keyboard, a real accessibility tree (`Snapshot`), and direct command execution (`PowerShell`).

## What it does

- **Look at the desktop** — `Screenshot` (fast PNG + window list) or `Snapshot` (accessibility tree with interactive element ids)
- **Interact** — `Click`, `Move`, `Scroll`, `Type`, `Shortcut`, `MultiSelect`, `MultiEdit`
- **Launch and manage** — `App` to open from Start menu, `Process` to list/kill, `Notification` to toast
- **Headless ops** — `PowerShell` (command execution), `FileSystem` (read/write/list), `Clipboard` (read/set), `Registry` (read/write/delete/list)
- **Utility** — `Wait`, `Scrape` (page text when a browser is foregrounded)

## When to invoke

Sandbox-specific triggers only: `agent-os`, `the agent-os VM`, `winbox`, `the windows sandbox`, `the tootie windows`, `drive the windows VM`, `spin up agent-os`, `open the noVNC`, or any "run X / screenshot agent-os" prompt. Does **not** fire on the user's personal Windows machine (steamy-wsl) - that target uses the `nircmd` skill.

## Web-dev browser priority

For browser verification and web-dev workflows, use this order unless the user asked for a specific session:

1. CDP running on agent-os
2. agent-browser
3. claude-in-chrome on agent-os
4. agent-os Windows-MCP
5. claude-in-chrome on steamy

Use Windows-MCP for desktop/OS state, native dialogs, installed Windows software, and browser work that must happen inside the sandbox desktop. Use `agent-browser` before Windows-MCP for generic fresh-browser checks.

## Connection

Configured as an HTTP MCP server in `~/.claude.json` under `mcpServers.windows-mcp` (Tailscale address + Bearer token). Claude Code reaches it automatically. Nothing to start.

If unreachable: `ssh tootie "docker ps --format '{{.Names}}' | grep agent-os"` to confirm the container (`agent-os-win11`) is up.

Side-channels exposed by the container, in case Windows-MCP is wedged:
- noVNC at `http://tootie:8006` (visual debug)
- RDP at `tootie:33890` (needs an agent-side RDP client)
- SSH at `tootie:2222` → guest port 22 (sshd inside the guest must be running; if it is, this is the cleanest scripted bypass)

## Key advantages over the legacy noVNC path

- **`Type` handles full strings reliably** — no more per-char `press` loops, no Shift-key flakiness
- **`Snapshot` returns interactive element ids** — target controls by accessibility, not pixel guessing
- **`PowerShell` runs commands directly** — anything expressible as a command bypasses the GUI entirely
- **No browser session to manage** — no `agent-browser open`, no canvas focus juggling

## Visual debugging fallback

noVNC at `http://tootie:8006/vnc.html?autoconnect=1&resize=remote` still works for eyeballing the desktop visually, but isn't the primary interaction surface anymore. See git history of `SKILL.md` for the legacy `agent-browser` helpers if you ever need them.
